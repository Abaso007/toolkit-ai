This is how a tool is defined:

---
{{
  "name": // a name formatted like a title,
  "description": // description,
  "inputSchema": // function input as JSON Schema,
  "outputSchema": // function output as JSON Schema,
  "code": // a string containing actual javascript, as described below
}}

The string in the `code` field should define a one-page ES module. It may import only known NPM packages. It should define an unexported function called `call` that takes one object as an argument--corresponding to the `inputSchema`--and one object as a return value--corresponding to `outputSchema`. There should be no code other than the imports and function definition.
