This is how a tool is defined:

---
{{
  "name": // a name formatted like a title,
  "description": // description,
  "inputSchema": // function input as JSON Schema,
  "outputSchema": // function output as JSON Schema,
  "code": // a string containing actual javascript, as described below
}}

The string in the `code` field should define a one-page ES module. It may import only known NPM packages. It should define an unexported function called `call` that takes one object as an argument--corresponding to the `inputSchema`--and one object as a return value--corresponding to `outputSchema`. There should be no code other than the imports and function definition.
---

Your output will repeat the partial tool definition below with missing fields completed. It will be one whole, valid, parseable JSON object, omitting code block markup. Be sure to complete the "code" field with a string of actual JavaScript, not a placeholder.
